title: "Needing to Plan"

As is made obvious by the fact that I wrote the blog post for the 20th on the 21st, and the fact that I'm writing
"today's" post on the morning of the 22nd, I'm not doing a great job of getting these done the day of. 

That being said, there's not a ton to talk about today. A lot of what I had time to work on was finishing off 
the beginnings of the Player struct. After setting up the Model, View, Controller traits, everything fell into 
place fairly quickly. Up to a point. 

By about 2pm I had the Player, PlayerController, and PlayerView all setup and was drawing a red circle and so I 
finally merged in all the MVC traits I had spent so much of the 20th working on. The issue I started to face was 
that there was a lot to do, and I was trying to plan on the spot as to how I wanted to do all of it. 

I didn't have a ton of time to work today, but I know that if I want this to work nicely, that tomorrow I need to 
reallly start to do some more serious planning. What concerns me is that I'm still learning Rust as I go, so I'm a 
worried I'll make a plan that isn't easily doable in Rust. Reguardless, I still need to do it, so lets get planning.

Not a long post today, a lot of the important stuff was covered in yesterday's post.
Thats all for now.
